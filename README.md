# MERN-stack-E-commerce
The project mentioned here is a complete e-commerce website developed using the MERN stack. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, which are all popular technologies used for building web applications.

The project aims to create a fully functional e-commerce website with features such as product listing, product details, shopping cart, user authentication, and payment integration. 

The front-end of the website is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Redux, a state management library, is also utilized to manage the application's state effectively.

On the server-side, the Express.js framework is used to handle HTTP requests and build the API endpoints required for the e-commerce functionality. Node.js serves as the runtime environment for running JavaScript on the server.

For data storage, the project utilizes MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to store product information, user details, and other relevant data.
